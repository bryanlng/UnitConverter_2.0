If it's hex, we need to change the keyboard from number (android:inputType = numberDecimal), to a keyboard with letters
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2586301/set-inputtype-for-an-edittext
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#attr_android%3ainputType

Situation: User was on Hex before, so we had to set a new inputType. However, they're on any of the other
ones right now, and they need the regular (number) keyboard
android:inputType="numberDecimal" is equivalent to InputType.TYPE_CLASS_NUMBER | InputType.TYPE_NUMBER_FLAG_DECIMAL


Open up a new AlertDialog, which has Spinners for Day, Month, Year, save button, and cancel button
Once user presses save button ==> exit menu and save the date
Once user presses cancel button ==> simply exit
need to use rootView.getContext() instead of getActivity().getApplicationContext()

/*
	I ended up not doing the idea where I would dynamically fill in the days spinner with values depending on the months spinner.
	This is b/c in the case of the leap year, we would need to call GregorianCalendar's isLeapYear() method, which would require us
	having the values year,month,day from the original Calendar in order to create the GregorianCalendar instance. Which we can't get
	just from the year

	Problem:
	However, this leaves a kind of big problem, as we're giving the user some options that will fail. Which is BAD.
	But there's not really any other way.

	solution:
	Actually I just thought about this before I went to sleep. The main thing hindering this was the situation that we wouldn't be able to
	get the year,month,day values at the same time, because some of them would be null. Well, I thought, why don't we just set default values
	to the year,month,day initially on startup?

	Flowchart:
	1. Year--> dynamically affects days (in the case of a leap year). Aka if month == 2 and its a leap year
	2. Month --> dynamically affects days.
	Thus we would set the year component first, then the month component, then the days component

//Get the Spinner components and set their associated adapters, which are created to hold a list of items specified in strings.xml
//Have to use alertDialogCustomView_starting instead of View v, b/c that's the View that actually contains the Spinners


Open up a new menu with a CalendarView inside it. Also have a save button
Once user presses save button ==> exit menu and save the date
http://androidopentutorials.com/android-datepickerdialog-on-edittext-click-event/
Use a DatePickerDialog instead. May have to implement onSaveInstanceState
Use constructor
DatePickerDialog(Context context, DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener listener, int year, int month, int dayOfMonth)




    /* method checkFormat deprecated b/c I implemented both:
       1) DatePickerDialog ==> no incorrect date ever
       2) Inside editText:
            -Since arrays keep getting dynamically added to Spinners ==> no incorrect date ever


        Checks if the date is valid
        Parameter: String textview for which textview it will affect, startingDay or endingDay
        This will be called inside AlertDialog.Builder's  setPositiveButton onClick() method

        Situations to check for:
            1. Is it a leap year (extra day in feb; feb 29) and month = february?
               http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7395699/calculate-leap-year-in-java
                -to do this w/o coming up with some extravagant formula, we need to make use of GregorianCalendar's isLeapYear(year) method
                -Thus, we would create a new GregorianCalendar using values from the current calendar
            2. Else is it a valid day ( don't want a month w/ only days to have a 31st day)

        Months:
        Jan: 31

data in case it ever gets lost
http://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html
New logic:
In order to not complicate this further enough, here's a much simpler way to approach the problem:
1. First, take starting date, clone it, and move the clone forwards to the next closest month
	a) Case 1: Clone date and ending date are in the SAME month.
		If this is the case, then DON'T move it forwards to the next closest month, and instead calculate difference in days,
		from which we can extract weeks and days from
	b) Case 2: Clone date and ending date are in different months.
		Proceed with moving it forwards to the next closest month

2. Then, enter a while loop
	-Get # of days in the current month
	a)If Clone date millis + (# days in current month in millis) < endingDate millis
		-Difference in time is still greater than a month, so let's move up a month
		-Move up clone date
		-Increment # of months ( keep track of this in a variable)
	b)else
		-(  If Clone date millis + (# days in current month in millis) > endingDate millis )
		-AKA Difference in time is less than a month now, so we need to break out of loop
		-End loop

3. Get # of days between Clone date and endingDate
	-From here, we can now extract weeks,days


Month will be defined as: the # of days it takes to get from (month1) day ==> (next month) day
		Jan: 31
        feb: <varies, but case covered specifically>
        mar: 31
        apr: 30
        may: 31
        jun: 30
        july: 31
        aug: 31
        sept: 30
        oct: 31
        nov: 30
        dec: 31

31->30:  31 days from Mar 5 to apr 5
30->31:  30 days from Apr 5 to may 5
31->31:  31 days from Dec 1 2016 - Jan 1 2017. (Dec- Jan, Jun - July)

Thus, we can see that the # of days considered to be in a "month" is the # of days from the STARTING MONTH.

Special cases:
1a. Dealing with transitions from months with 31 days --> months with 30 days
	1) Any regular day (aka not 31) ==> will just be # of days from the STARTING MONTH.
	2) However, if the starting day is 31, then # of days will just be the day value of the next month.
	   Aka 3/31 --> 4/15 ==> is 15 days
1b. Dealing with transitions from months with 30 days --> months with 31 days
	1) Any regular day (aka not 30) ==> will just be # of days from the STARTING MONTH.
	2) However, if the starting day is 30, then # of days will just be the day value of the next month.
	   Aka 4/30 --> 5/15 ==> is 15 days, 4/30 --> 5/31 ==> is 31 days

2. Leap Years
Jan -> Feb (31 - 29) leap year:
Jan -> Feb (31 - 28) non leap year:

Feb -> March leap year:
Feb -> March non leap year:
